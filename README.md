# -Mental-Health-in-Tech-Survey-arogo
This project aims to develop an AI-powered mental health assessment model that predicts potential mental health conditions based on user symptoms. The model utilizes machine learning (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks, etc.) to classify mental health conditions and provide interpretability using SHAP/LIME.
